<h2>Verb lexicons for narrative detection (in Finnish) </h2>

This data set has been produced for developing computational narrative detection methods for political discourse. Verb lexicons have been collected and classified approximately 4000 verb lexemes extracted from an interview corpus of former MPs in Finnish Parliament. The semantic classification - cognitive processing (n=96), emotion (n=277), and scpeech acts (n=300) - is based on theoretical framework of lexical argument structures (see e.g. Rappaport Hovav and Levin 2015; Pajunen 2001).
