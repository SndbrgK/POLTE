<h2>Verb lexicons for narrative detection (in Finnish) </h2>

This data set has been produced for the purposes of developing computational narrative detection methods for political language use. Verbs have been collected from an interview corpus of former MPs in Finnish Parliament, approximately extracted 4000 verb lexemes (see Andrushchenko et al.2021).
The semantic classification - cognitive processing (n=96), emotion (n=277), and scpeech acts (n=300) - is based on theoretical framework of lexical argument structures (see e.g. Rappaport Hovav and Levin 2015; Pajunen 2001).
